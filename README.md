Spots: a project by Kai Follett

This page is designed to allow users to share photos with other users. Spots features an interactive profile with a like function that allows
other users to express appreciation for your work. This project transforms seamlessly between desktop, tablet, and mobile viewing to allow
the best user experience no matter the device.

This project utilizes BEM Methodology to keep file paths clean and organized as well as integrated adaptive design that allows for seamless
transitions between screen sizes with no horizontal scrolling. To achieve the automatic transition I paired display: grid; with the media query
to allow the rows of photos to collapse under each other as dictated by the screen resolution that the project is being viewed on.
